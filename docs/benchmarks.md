# Benchmarks

Here we compare Groebner.jl vs Singular.jl groebner implementations over fields of *characteristic zero*. The table below lists runtimes for several standard benchmark systems in seconds

TODO


The comparison is not entirely fair at the moment: Singular verifies obtained result, and we do not. (TODO)

 (TODO: add links and refs to systems)

 (TODO: compare with other CAS)
