## Testsuite for benchmarking Groebner bases

We list test systems, which are **either widely known or 
come from recognized applications** in 
life sciences and are currently **considered hard enough**
for Groebner bases computation.

- A tiny set of **classic** (and mostly zero dimensional) systems (in particular, a couple systems from the Posso suite);
- A set of **steady state** ideals obtained from chemical reaction
networks (CRNs) emerging from the ODE **parameter identifiability** problem (by courtesy of Ilia Ilmer and Gleb Pogudin);
- A set of finite field system solving examples, 
in particular from the **Fukuoka MQ challenge** (https://www.mqchallenge.org/);

All of the examples above are given either over rationals or over
finite fields, and majority are computed in degree reverse lexicographic ordering.

In total, the maximum of 20 + 20 + 20 systems
were used.
